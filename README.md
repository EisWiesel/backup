backup
==========================

A small and simple backupscript which makes incremental recursive backups of directories, saving them in ordered human readable timestamped directories using rsync, locks and hardlinks. 

**enviroment, depencies, installation, interface, usage...**

**Enviroment:**
This script has only been tested on a gentoo linux x64 machine with perl5. I will add details later...

**Depencies:** 
- perlmodules Data::Dumper, File::Path and JSON are needed
- the programs "cp" and "rsync" are needed
- I will add details for perl later...

**Installation:**
You should create a directory and put that script, along with its configurationfile into that directory.
I will add details later...

**Interface, usage:**
Command-line based. This script is executed from the command-line. I suggest using a cronjob to run it.
I will add details later...
